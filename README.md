# easyHackUSB
A simple Python script to construct a bootable Hackintosh Install USB.

**KEEP IN MIND:** This script will only construct the **bare minimum**. Configuring the config, installing more kexts, adding SSDTs etc. has to be done manually.

## Development status
**easyHackUSB** is **60%** done.

**Current task:** Step 2. - Preparing the USB - Downloading the bootloader

## How it works
The script is pretty simple.
Everything the script does is just automate the steps found on the [Dortania Guide](https://dortania.gitbook.io).
