# easyHackUSB
A simple Python script to construct a bootable Hackintosh Install USB.

**KEEP IN MIND:** This script will only construct the bare minimum to boot macOS. Configuring the config, installing more kexts, adding SSDTs etc. has to be done manually.

## How it works
The script is pretty simple.
All it does it automates the process found on [Dortania](https://dortania.gitbook.io).
